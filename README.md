# Flight-Paths-Project

This project reads in a file containing a list of flights from one city to another, and creates a graph to represent all possible flights. Each flight contains a source city, destination city, the amount of money it costs, and the amount of time it takes. The program then reads in another file which contains a list of flights that the user would like to take. The flights in this file contain a start city, destination city, and a string to specify whether the flights should be sorted by time or cost. The program then finds all possible paths to fly from the start and destination cities in the flight request file using the graph created from the flight data file. After finding all possible paths, the program then sorts the paths based on either time or cost depending on the specification in the flight request file. After sorting all of the possible flights, the program outputs the three best flights to the console, and repeates this process for each requested flight in the flight request file. A sample flight data file and flight request file has been included in this repository.

To run this project, run the flightPlan.java file and pass the input file containing the list of all possible flights, and the input file containing the list of requested flights as the first and second arguments, respectively. 

Example call from a linux command line after compilation is complete: java flightplan <FlightDataFile> <FlightRequestsFile>
